Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find the position of a target element within a sorted array or list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half and comparing the target element to the middle element of the range. Here's how it works step-by-step:

1. Start with the whole sorted list as the search range.
2. Find the middle element of the range:
   - If the middle element equals the target, the search is complete.
   - If the target is smaller than the middle element, search only the left half of the range.
   - If the target is larger than the middle element, search only the right half of the range.
3. Repeat the process on the remaining half until either the target is found or the search range is empty.

This approach is highly efficient because it eliminates half of the remaining elements in each step, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This makes binary search much faster than a linear search which has O(n) complexity when working with large, sorted data sets. 

Example of Binary Search:
If you have a sorted list: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]` and you are looking for `9`:
1. Start with the whole list, middle element is `7` (at index 3).
2. `9` is greater than `7`, so narrow the search to `[9, 11, 13, 15]`.
3. The middle element is now `11` (at index 5).
4. `9` is less than `11`, so narrow the search to `[9]`.
5. The middle element is `9`, which matches the target.

The target `9` is found at index 4.
